# Machine-Learning-for-Cryptocurrencies
As a part of my Independent study, I am working on performing Machine Learning on the cryptocurrencies universe. 
My project is divided into two parts. 
1- I will perform linear classifier on the historical cryptocurriencies prices and make function using the classifier. 
2- I am currently performing trend analysis and news text mining to create function to predict prices of Bitcoin based on news, 
Google search trends and reddit trends.
